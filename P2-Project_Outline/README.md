## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I will be building a garden tracking app. I will be able to see what plants I have in which garden beds around my yard. I will include important information about the plants including scientific and common names, light needs, water needs, bloom timeframes, flower photos, and bed location.

I came up with this idea with my mom. It is a program she always intended to make but never got around to it and I think it will be useful to me as well as my garden grows at my own house. We will be colabrating together and she will act as the "client" for my project.
